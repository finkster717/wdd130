                <p>Hello! My name is Michael Fink. I am an aspiring Software Developer pursuing a Bachelor’s degree at Brigham Young University - Idaho.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Shortly after receiving a laptop as a 13th birthday present, I became very curious about how programs on a computer work. During my teenage years I learned how to make 3D models and animate them on a program called Blender, I discovered online resources which taught me about writing HTML and CSS code for a website, and I learned about Microsoft SQL database modeling. More recently, from 2018 to 2020, I was privileged to own and operate my own business called Fink’s Integration Services LLC. During that time I got experience in organizing a database of all the electrical equipment and their live status in a hospital using a tool called Metasys Building Automation System. Now, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree at Brigham Young University - Idaho<br>
