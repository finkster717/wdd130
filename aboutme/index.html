    <p>Hey y'all! My name is Michael Fink, you can call me by my first or last name,
    I'm used to both. I don't really have any specific nick names. I'm 27 years old and 
    am originally from Minnesota, but I moved to Tennessee shortly after turning 19 years 
    old and have been here ever since. I am married and have a 2 year old daughter, with 
    another baby on the way.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development. This is my
    third attempt at pursuing a degree and I'm cautiously optimistic about it. Life has a 
    way of interupting my goals, but I just keep trying anyway.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include PC gaming (mostly MMORPG's), reading, shooting, gunsmithing, 
    archery, hiking, and camping. Between all those things I spend the most time gaming 
    and reading because they're the most convenient.</p>
